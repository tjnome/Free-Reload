[h1]Compatibility[/h1]

This mod is compatible with existing saves. Loading a saved game in-mission from before the installation will work. Like all mods currently, uninstalling this mod will cause the game to refuse to load saved games that were created while this mod was installed. This can be worked around by the "Ignore Missing DLC" mod.
